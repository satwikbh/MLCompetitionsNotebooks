Deep Learning has given us tremendous power in the field of computer vision. In some fields of vision ,computers can now see and perceive beyond human capabilities. But with great power comes responsibility. The problem we have for you is to classify the patient's retina as being diabetic or not diabetic taking into consideration the available image features in the dataset.\n","\n","**Dataset:** \\\\\n","This dataset contains features extracted from the Messidor image set to predict whether an image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not. There are total of 20 attributes to this dataset, out of which first 19 attributes represents a descriptive features extracted from the image set. Last attribute label is 1 if image shows signs of Diabetic Retinopathy and 0 if image does not show signs of Diabetic Retinopathy. For details about attributes visit here!.\n","\n","**Files:** \\\\\n","1. train.csv - (920 samples) File that should be used for training. It contains in csv format, the feature representation of the images along with the binary label for each such representation.\n","2. test.csv - (230 samples) File that will be used for actual evaluation for the leaderboard score. It contains only the feature representation of the images and not their binary labels.\n","\n","**Submission:** \\\\\n","Prepare a csv containing header as label and predicted value as digit 0 or 1 representing whether or not the image shows signs of diabetic retionpathy.\n","The name of above file should be submission.csv. Sample submission format available at sample_submission.csv.\n","\n","**Evaluation Criteria:** \\\\\n","During evaluation F1 score will be used to test the efficiency of the model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i0B62Qi6JbRt","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Google Drive Mount and
